# Wren (Working Title)

This is a colisseum hack-n-slash game I'm working on mainly to showcase my ability to work with audio implementation middle-ware. At the time of writing this README, I'm still working on getting the basic game framework setup, so really I'm just working on an indie game until such a time that it's relatively working well. If someone comes across this and wants to make suggestions or code some functionality they think might be useful, **please push to public_testing_branch**, just to make things easier on me, as this is mainly a personal project that I want to be visible for employers/people checking out my work.

Thanks for checking out my work if you do find this!
