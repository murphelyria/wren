- Currently have setup functionality for:
	- Movement
		- Standard
			- Moves at a slower speed when just idly walking around
		- Sprint
			- If it spots the player, it will sprint towards them
		- Player Detection
			- Has a further detection range in front than behind to simulate the difference between seeing the player and hearing the player behind them
	- Attacking
		- After spring towards the player, the enemy will stop for a moment before spawning an AttackPrefab in front of itself (need to cleanup, some of the code is redundant now that I am using project prefabs rather than my earlier implementation where I had the attack prefabs as children of the enemy and player game objects)
- Any other code not mentioned here is to support the features mentioned above. Check the code for more detailed notes (yet to be fully implemented, working on it).

- Another thing that I'll mention here and not in a seperate note is the EnemyAttackController, which handles dealing damage to the player based on collision with EnemyAttackPrefab
