- Right now most a temp sprite to allow for testing of scripts
- Want to get an actual character model and work on animations for it

- EnemyHealthBar.cs gets a mention here for the moment, as I don't want to dedicate a whole page to it, this handles a temporary feature of a health bar above the enemy for testing purposes, shall be removed later
